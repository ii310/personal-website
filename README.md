> *"a digital asset that represents my academic interests, personal projects and experiences"*

The goal of this project is to create a digital asset that represents my academic interests, personal projects, and creative explorations in the field of motion simulation in a 3D, interactive, dynamic, and technical form, as a solo software project from scratch through its entire lifecycle; from ideation and visual prototyping to frontend development, version control, and live deployment.

## Project Objectives

- Integrate modern front-end technologies with a focus on modular design and visual clarity.
- Practice deployment workflows using GitHub Pages and custom build pipelines.
- Experiment with interactive modeling through tools like Three.js and React-based visualization.

# Technical Learnings and Exploration Through the Building Process
## This project was an opportunity to:

- Deepen my understanding of component-based architecture, and front-end engineering practices

- Streamlined Deployment Workflow: Using Git, npm, and GitHub Pages, created an automated deployment pipeline that enables rapid iteration and consistent version control.

- Three.js & @react-three/fiber: Integrated real-time 3D rendering into a React-based frontend, gaining experience with scene composition, lighting, and object interaction.

- Tailwind CSS: Developed a responsive and visually consistent UI using a utility-first CSS framework. 

- Vite: Optimize builds and development flow using Vite’s fast bundler and modern tooling.

- Component-Based Design in React: Improved modularization and state management practices by building reusable UI components and structuring code for maintainability.

- Project Lifecycle Management: Experienced the lifecycle of a solo software project—from ideation and visual prototyping to frontend development, version control, and live deployment.

# Features & Architecture

- **Single Page Application (SPA):** Built using React and dynamically rendered via `main.jsx`.
- **3D Model Rendering:** Integrates a GLB model using Three.js and @react-three/fiber for spatial interactivity.
- **Responsive Layout:** Uses utility-first CSS classes (Tailwind) to support mobile, tablet, and desktop resolutions.

# Deployment Workflow
~ npm run build compiles the app to /dist

~ gh-pages package publishes the build directory to the gh-pages branch

~ GitHub Pages hosts the output using the configured homepage field in package.json
